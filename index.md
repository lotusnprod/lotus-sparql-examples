# SPARQL examples

This repository provides a collection of SPARQL query examples in various formats, tailored for different projects linked to LOTUS with publicly available SPARQL endpoints.

We continuously expand this collection to highlight diverse use cases, including:

* [NPs](./examples/NPs/)
* [Taxa](./examples/Taxa/)
* [Varia](./examples/Varia/)
* [Maintenance](./examples/Maintenance/)

This repository is based on the work by the [SIB Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics](https://www.sib.swiss/),
and specifically [this repository](https://github.com/sib-swiss/sparql-examples).
